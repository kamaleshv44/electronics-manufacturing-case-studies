## Micron EMS Pvt. Ltd. — PCB Manufacturing Internship

### Company Context
Micron EMS Pvt. Ltd. is an **electronics manufacturing services (EMS) company** specializing in **PCB fabrication, assembly, and testing** for industrial and commercial electronics.

The internship provided hands-on exposure to **real-world PCB manufacturing workflows**, quality control processes, and production constraints that directly impact embedded system reliability.

---

### Internship Objective
The objective of the internship was to gain **end-to-end understanding of PCB manufacturing**, from design interpretation to fabrication, assembly, and testing, with emphasis on **process quality and defect prevention**.

---

### Key Areas of Exposure

#### PCB Manufacturing Process
- Single-layer and multi-layer PCB fabrication
- Copper etching, drilling, and lamination processes
- Solder mask application and surface finishing

#### PCB Assembly
- Through-Hole Technology (THT)
- Surface Mount Technology (SMT)
- Component placement and soldering techniques

#### Inspection & Quality Control
- Visual inspection standards
- Continuity and short-circuit testing
- Defect identification and rework processes

---

### Engineering Learnings
- How **PCB design decisions** affect manufacturability
- Importance of **tolerances, trace widths, and pad layouts**
- Common production defects and how they are mitigated
- Relationship between **hardware quality and embedded system reliability**

---

### Tools & Processes Observed
- PCB fabrication machinery
- Assembly and soldering equipment
- Testing and inspection tools
- Production workflow documentation

---

### Industry Relevance
This experience provides practical understanding of:
- Design-for-Manufacturing (DFM)
- Hardware quality assurance
- Production constraints in embedded systems
- How firmware and hardware teams interface with manufacturing units

Such knowledge is critical for **embedded, IoT, and R&D engineers** working on production hardware.

---

### Key Takeaway for Recruiters
This internship demonstrates **manufacturing-awareness**, which is a strong differentiator for embedded engineers who will work on **real products**, not just prototypes.
